# Minecraft-RPG_Godot_VoxelToolsModule
A Minecraft-inspired RPG built with the Voxel Tools Module for Godot 4.5 instead, in this case it's not C#.
Instead of a pure sandbox, the focus is on guild progression, village life, and cooperative challenges. Players can join guilds, complete chores, missions, and quests, and take part in raids that shape the future of the village.

Features (planned & in-progress):

Procedural, block-based world inspired by Minecraft

Unique guild progression system (miner, explorer, farmer, etc.)

Daily chores & missions for building reputation

Large-scale raids & quests

RPG elements layered on top of voxel-style gameplay

Now, huge thanks for the original project from Zylann (https://github.com/Zylann/voxelgame) and enjoy what I will make here, with the help of all of you.
